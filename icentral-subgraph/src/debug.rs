/*
 | When Jesus came into the coasts of CÃ¦sarea
 | Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do
 | men say that I, the Son of man, am?
 |
 | And they said, Some say that thou art John the
 | Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one
 | of the prophets.
 |
 | He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
 |
 | And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the
 | Christ, the Son of the living God.
 |
 | And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art
 | thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not
 | revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
 | heaven.
 |
 | And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and
 | upon this rock I will build my church; and the
 | gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
 |
 | And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
 | of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
 | shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou
 | shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
 |
 | Then charged he his disciples that they should
 | tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
 |
 | From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his
 | disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and
 | suffer many things of the elders and chief priests
 | and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again
 | the third day.
 |
 | Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him,
 | saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not
 | be unto thee.
 |
 | But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee
 | behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for
 | thou savourest not the things that be of God, but
 | those that be of men.
 |
 | Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man
 | will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
 | up his cross, and follow me.
 |
 | For whosoever will save his life shall lose it:
 | and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall
 | find it.
 |
 | For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the
 | whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall
 | a man give in exchange for his soul?
 |
 | For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his
 | Father with his angels; and then he shall reward
 | every man according to his works.
 |
 | Verily I say unto you, There be some standing
 | here, which shall not taste of death, till they
 | see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
